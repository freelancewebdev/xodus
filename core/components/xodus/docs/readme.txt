Extra: Xodus
--------------------
Version: 1.0
 
Xodus is a simple MODX Revolution extra to enable the export of users from chosen user groups to CSV or Excel file format.

Xodus was coded by Joe Molloy <info@hyper-typer.com> and first released in November 2012.

Xodus makes use of a slightly modified version of PHPExcel (http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/).  The modification just changes the location of the temporary folder used by the library so that it works without issue on shared hosting systems with open_basedir restrictions which exclude use of the system temporary folder.

You can find more information on Xodus in the blog post dedicated to it at http://www.hyper-typer.com/news/xodus-export-modx-users.
